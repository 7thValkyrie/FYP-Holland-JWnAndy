What a fabulous lyre you have with you! If it is alright with you, may I borrow it for awhile?
How dare you Foolish mortal try to borrow our lyre!
This lyre is way beyond you, you filthy beast!
Is there really no way for me to convince you ladies to lend me that lyre?
Hmmmm, well maybe if you find us an accessory of the highest quality we might consider it…
Consider it done.
What is that comb? It is so… gorgeous!
Where did you find it! I simply must know!
Can I borrow your lyre now? If not then I will be taking this comb back with me to Ithaca.
Give it here! That comb is mine! 
No way! I saw it first! It belongs to me!
It is mine! I was the one suggested the idea!
Now, since they are fighting over that old comb, let me just grab the lyre and hurry leave this place…
