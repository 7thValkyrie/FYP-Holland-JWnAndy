Mother? Is that you?
My son, why have you come into the underworld? Are you still trying to find your way back home to Ithaca?
I came here to seek out the Prophet Tiresias for instructions on how to return to Ithaca. How did you end up here mother? What about father, my wife and also my son? Are they well? I was so worried for you that I fell ill and passed on. Your father is still living in his old home, but he does not have proper bedding and wears nothing but rags as he grieves about how you never return home. Your wife still remains ever faithful to you, but she is usually distressed and spends her whole time in tears both day and night. Your son, Telemachus, still holds your land undisturbed and he has to entertain a lot of people as he is the magistrate.
Oh mother, how could I have let you all suffer so much? Let me embrace you, for it may be the last time I can ever do so...
Son, you cannot touch me, for I am no longer flesh and bones.
If we could throw our arms around one another we might find sad comfort in the sharing of our sorrows even in the underworld… Does Proserpine intend to make me grieve even more by mocking me with only a phantom?
All people are like this when they  are dead. As soon as life has left the body, the flesh and bones perishes in the fierceness of consuming fire, and the soul flits away as though it were a dream. Here, take this jewel I found. It will help you in your quest.
Thank you mother.
…
I guess… this is goodbye, mother. I… will miss you…
Take care my poor, unfortunate child. I wish you the best in your journey.
