Oh thank you so much! I want you to help me get some water from the Fountain of Lethe just past the Hall of Flames. It is said that after drinking the water, one can withstand any form of pain! Being chained here has brought me so much pain for so long, I cannot take it anymore! Please hurry!3<OPTION>

I will see what I can do. In the meantime, please bear with the pain for just a bit longer.
