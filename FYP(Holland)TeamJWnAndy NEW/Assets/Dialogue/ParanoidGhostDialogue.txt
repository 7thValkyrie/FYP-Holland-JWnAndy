Oh poor ghost, why are you shaking?
When I was still alive, I got tricked by a cunning merchant to buy this magical bowl and right after that, it started raining so I hid under the tree with it and soon enough I got struck by lightning and died. I want to get rid of this cursed bowl by throwing it down the bridge, but I am afraid that I will get even more bad luck if I toss the bowl off the cliff.<QNS>

Give it to me. I will take on the curse for myself.<CHOICE>
