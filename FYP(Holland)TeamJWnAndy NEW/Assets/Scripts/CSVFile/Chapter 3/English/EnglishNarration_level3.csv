BETWEEN SCENE 1 AND 2
The chef prepares the deer with the help of Odysseus' crew and they eat and drink their fill.
The party ends and the sun begins to rise. Odysseus approaches his second in command named Eurylochus.
BETWEEN SCENE 2 AND 3
Circe took Eurylochus' men inside her home and prepared a feast for them. Eurylochus was cautious and stayed outside.
After the feast Circe cast a spell which turned the men into pigs and locked them in her pigsty!
Eurylochus saw this from outside and ran away. He was horrified as he ran back to tell Odysseus of this.
