FIRST DIALOGUE WITH ELPENOR
Elpenor
"Odysseus, we need to find supplies. The men are hungry and we have no idea where we are!"
Odysseus
"Don't worry, Elpenor! I'll go scout the area and find us something to eat!"
"I feel like we've had this same discussion before, Elpenor."
"Why not send someone to scout the area, then?"
Elpenor
"That is for the best, sir. Lead with your example!"
"I have no idea what you mean, Sir!"
"Sir, the men are starving. They are not fit for a task like that!"
odysseus
"I know. I'm the best, aren't I?"
"…I'll just go scout the area, then."
"Hmh, Weaklings! I'll do it myself."
FIRST DIALOGUE WITH CHEF
Odysseus
"Why are you not making food for the men, chef? The men are hungry!"
Chef
"Sir, our reserves are empty. There is nothing to eat."
Odysseus
"Why don't you go find something to eat, then?"
"Alright, I'll see if I can find anything for you to cook."
Chef
"Surely you are joking, sir? I am not a hunter or a warrior!"
"Thank you, sir. Please tell me if you find anything of use."
odysseus
"Then what good are you? Hmph, I'll just go find something myself!"
"As soon as I find anything, you'll be the first one to know."
DIALOGUE WITH MAN ON BOARD
"I'm so hungry, I could eat a horse!"
"yeah, me too."
AFTER GIVING DEER TO CHEF
Odysseus
"Chef, start making a feast for the men!"
Chef
"With pleasure, sir!"
SCENE 2 (REMEMBER THAT EURYLOCHUS IS THE PLAYABLE CHARACTER NOW)
ODYSSEUS DIALOGUE WITH EURYLOCHUS
odysseus
"Eurylochus, my friend. While scouting yesterday I saw smoke coming from the woods. I want you to take twenty men with you and go meet the natives."
Eurylochus
"Odysseus, why won't you do it yourself? My throat is sore from yesterday and I don't think I'd be a good speaker…"
"Understood, sir."
Odysseus
"Eurylochus, I've done more than my part without complaining. I think it's only fair I get the easy job once in a while."
"Report back to me if you find anything interesting, Eurylochus."
SHORE CREWMAN
I feel I'm lucky that I got picked to guard the ship… No offense.
MAZE CREWMAN
All the roads lead back to the clearing! We're lost!
CIRCE BEFORE TEA
Eurylochus
…Hello? Miss?
Circe
(No response)
Eurylochus
"(Damnit, she can't hear me and my throat is too sore for shouting…)"
CASTLE CREWMAN
Eurylochus
You! Get her attention!
Crewman
"Sir, I think it'd be best if you contacted her. As our leader and all."
Eurylochus
Damn. I guess I need to think of a way to get her attention by myself then…
CIRCE AFTER TEA
Eurylochus
"Now that I've had a drink, I can try again! Hello! Can you hear me in there?"
Circe
Oh? Who's calling for me?
Eurylochus
It is I! Eurylochus the great!
"I am but a lost traveller from Ithaca, looking for food and shelter with my men."
My name is Eurylochus. I was sent by Odysseus to meet the natives of this island.
Circe
"The great, is it? Well, bring your men in and I'll see what I can do for you, ""your highness""."
"A lost traveller, hm? Why don't you come in and let me help you and your men?"
"Odysseus? I have not heard of him. Come inside, let me prepare a meal for you and your men."
SCENE 3
Eurylochus on chapter start
Odysseus
"Eurylochus, what's the matter? You look as if you'd seen a ghost!"
Eurylochus
"There was a witch in the castle! She turned my comrades into pigs, Odysseus!"
Odysseus
"Pigs? Eurylochus, are you sure you didn't have too much wine to drink?"
"Are you serious? If you are, we need to go rescue them!"
"Calm down, I have no idea what you are talking about!"
Eurylochus
"Why would I lie to you? I wouldn't lie to you, sir!"
"No, I am never going back there! Not even if you'd threaten to cut me down where I stand! You can go save them yourself!"
"When we first arrived at her home, she offered us fine food and drink. I stayed outside because I was suspicious. Soon after the men had eaten, she cast a magic spell on all of them, turning them into pigs and locking them away!"
Odysseus
"Fine, fine. I'll go and check it out."
"What are you, a coward? I'll go rescue our comrades by myself."
"Why didn't you say that in the first place? You stay here and rest, you've earned it."
Eyrulochus after this
Odysseus
"Eurylochus, about what happened in the castle…"
Eurylochus
"Y-Yes, Odysseus?"
Odysseus
"Can you tell me what happened in the castle again, Eurylochus?"
"Can you show me the way to the castle, Eurylochus?"
Eurylochus
"When we first arrived at her home, she offered us fine food and drink. I stayed outside because I was suspicious. Soon after the men had eaten, she cast a magic spell on all of them, turning them into pigs and locking them away!"
"No, sir. I don't dare go back. I don't want to be turned into a pig like the rest of them!"
Odysseus
"Thank you, Eurylochus."
"Are you too afraid to help our friends, Eurylochus? You are a coward."
Chef on shore
Odysseus
"is there anything left to eat, chef? I don't know how long I will be gone."
Chef
"There is some leftover meat but I cannot cut it myself, my knives have become dull."
Odysseus
"I'll just use my sword instead! Step aside, let me handle this!"
Odysseus (again)
"(On another thought, I should sharpen my sword beforehand. Just in case.)"
Odysseus (Once more)
"Actually, nevermind. I'm not hungry anyway."
Chef after sharpening sword
Odysseus
"Step aside, I'll cut some meat for myself!"
Hermes at the clearing
Odysseus
"Where did you come from, stranger? Who are you?"
Hermes
"I am Hermes, messenger of the gods. I know what perils await you in Circe's castle and do not want you to come to harm, Odysseus. I want to offer you my help."
Odysseus
"Surely you don't think I believe you? For all I know, this might be a trap!"
"I would be grateful for any help you can offer me, Hermes."
Hermes
"What choice do you have? If you go into the castle of the witch without being prepared, you will only invite doom to yourself."
"Good choice. Listen carefully to what I am going to tell you, as it is the only thing that can save you from the Witch."
Hermes (again)
"The witch will prepare a feast for you, but she will enchant the food and the drink. After you drink and eat, she will strike you with her magic wand and turn you into a pig like the rest of your men."
Odysseus
"And what can I do to stop this from happening? That didn't sound very helpful, really."
Hermes
"Do you see that root over there? Mortal men cannot uproot it, but we gods can do with it what we will. I will give this herb for you. Using it will make you immune to the enchantment in the food and drink. Then, you must threaten Circe to let your men go."
Hermes (again)
"But be careful! She will try to seduce you and lure you into another trap. You must stay firm and refuse her offers. Only when your men are free can you rest easy. Do you understand, Odysseus?"
Odysseus
I understand.
Meeting with Circe (First)
Odysseus
"Circe, release my men at once!"
Circe
"Oh, Odysseus. I have been waiting for you. I will do what you ask, but let's not hurry. Have a drink, first. The wine is excellent."
Odysseus
"(Alright, I need to remember what Hermes said!)"
Odysseus (again)
"Of course, anything for a beautiful woman such as yourself."
Talking to Circe again before using Moly with the wine
Circe
"Odysseus, why are you not drinking? Are you not feeling well?"
Odysseus
"I will drink, but only after my men are freed!"
"Oh, sorry, I'll drink the wine now."
Circe
"Sure, sure. We can discuss this but please, atleast taste the wine first. It is exquisite."
"No need to apologize, sweetie. Take your time."
Talking to Circe after using Moly on Wine and drinking it.
Circe
"Ha! Now you will turn into a pig, just like the rest of your pathetic men! Go on into the pigsty and join them, you fool!"
Odysseus
"I'm afraid not, Circe!"
"(The player controls should be locked so that he cannot move, he can only use his sword on Circe)"
Using sword on Circe
Circe
"Please spare me, Odysseus! I promise I will bring you no harm. Let us be friends instead."
Odysseus
"How can I believe your words when my men are still locked in your pigsty, you witch? You were trying to trick me too, and now you still try to plot against me. Release my men and promise you will not harm any of us."
Circe
"I promise. I'll free your men and you will come to no harm, Odysseus, son of Laertes. "
Back on the ship
Odysseus
"Men! Our comrades have been turned back and a massive feast has been prepared to us. Let's go, we wouldn't want to keep our host waiting!"
Eyrulochus
Don't listen to Odysseus! Don't you remember what happened with the Cyclops? This is yet another trap where Odysseus is leading us!
Odysseus
I will not tolerate talk like that. I'll make you eat those words!
Start Minigame
Odysseus
There! Now stay here and guard the ship while we go party!
Eurylochus
"W-Wait! I'll come too, I don't want to be left alone in here!"

I should get to Circe now.
