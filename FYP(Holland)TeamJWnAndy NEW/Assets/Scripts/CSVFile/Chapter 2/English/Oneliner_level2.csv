Nooooooo!!! I can't combine this!
I might be drunk
I can't combine this
This isn't working right
 Stop... Doing... Random combining!!
Jesus! Why can't I combine this?!
Unable to combine
I do what I want... NOT!!
Please try again!
It doesn't make any sense!
Ah ha! My lovely wine!
You filled the goat skin with wine! You can still fill more wine in!
You filled the goat skin with wine! It's almost full!
You filled the goat skin with wine! It's full now!
You filled the goat skin with wine! There's still space for more though.
Nice and long tree branch I have here!
Hehehehe! He will not know where i place the stick!
OMG! FIREEEEEE!!!!!!!
I Hope the God will like the taste of the cheese!
Don’t be so rash Odysseus, we can’t move the slab even with 12 horses!
The men can now hide in the sheeps and escape.
Maybe I could up this feat a little, 'fire' up the stakes, get where I'm going with this?
Much Better!
Sir! Why don't you start the fire first before we start eating the cheese!
Pfff, don't teach me what to do.
Sir! Why don't you burn the cheese to offer the god!
Pfff, don't teach me what to do!!
Sir! There aren't enough cheese to feed all the men!
Fine, I will look for more cheese...
Sir! Please give us order to kill the cyclops!
Men, I will think of an idea first...
Such beautiful tree branch.. I have an idea of dealing with the Cyclops!!
I'm not going back in there again!
I should quickly get out of here.
We need to think of a way to get out of here.
The path is now open!
Sir. Do you want anything to eat?
No thanks.
Do you have anything to light the wood with?
No.
Yes Sir! Here's a flint.
My hands are too full!
Such beautiful tree branch.. I have an idea of dealing with the Cyclops!
It's burning brightly!
He is asleep. Now it's my chance!
I need to help my men escape first!
