SCENE 1
Sword
My sword is where it should be.
Spear
This is the perfect weapon for hunting.
Silver thread
This is the bag that held the wind in. It's empty now.
This string that held the bag closed might come in handy.
Long grass
This grass looks surprisingly sturdy.
I'd cut my hands if I tried that!
Deer
It appears to be drinking. I shouldn't startle it.
I'm not going to wrestle a deer!
I need to be further away.
The deer is dead because of my magnificent throw.
The deer is too hard to carry back without tying its legs together first.
Cliffview - Maze
There appears to be a winding path in the woods.
Cliffview - Deer
Cliffview - Smoke
"Where there's smoke, there's fire. Someone has to live there!"
I can see the deer clearly from here.
Rope
This rope should be strong enough for carrying a horse!
How clever of me. Tying the deer's legs together makes it easy for me to carry.
Beehive
And risk getting stung by the bees? No thank you!
River
The water looks drinkable. The shallow riverbed is full of smooth rocks.
Moly
This plant is called Moly. It cannot be uprooted by mortal men.
EXTRAS FOR SCENE 1
Cabinet
There's nothing inside. I gave all the wine to the Cyclops earlier.
Boat on shore
I can use this boat to get back to the ship.
Wineskin
This thing has been empty for days already.
SCENE 2
Helmet
"This looks rather silly, but it should protect me from any bees"
I wish I had some other container for the water but this will do.
Helmet with water
Embers
These embers are still warm from yesterday's feast.
The water is warm now.
This should help me with my sore throat!
Cliffview - Maze
There appears to be a winding path in the woods.
Cliffview - Smoke
I suppose that is where Odysseus wants me to go.
Beehive
"I can't reach up there and if I could, I'd get stung."
I can knock it down with my spear but then the bees would attack.
There we go!
Honeycomb
Now I can get some delicious honey from the hive!
River
The water looks drinkable. The shallow riverbed is full of smooth rocks.
I don't need any water right now.
"Ah, the water was cool and refreshing."
Silk veil
This veil of silk looks incredibly finely woven. I wonder what it's doing here?
"Now that I have the honey, I don't need the silk anymore."
Helmet with tea
Helmet with warm tea
Helmet with warm water
The door is locked.
SCENE 3
Moly
Smooth stone
This should protect me from Circe's magic.
Goblet
I'm not entirely sure if this is safe to drink yet…
Venison
This should keep those animals away from me!
Smooth stone
Now my sword is as sharp as my wit again!
"It is distracted now, I shouldn't attract its attention."
I need to distract both the wolf and lion.
Scene 2 extra - Warm tea
This should help with my sore throat!
This stone looks perfect for honing my blade!
I should use it to hunt the deer.
I should use it to throw it at the beehive.
