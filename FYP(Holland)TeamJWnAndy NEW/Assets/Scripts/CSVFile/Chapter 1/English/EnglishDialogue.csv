"Your highness Odysseus, we are reaching an island soon. As you previously instructed, this ship will dock at the coast so that we may search for food on land. A hungry crew is not a crew that is ready to fight!"
Not ready? Why would I lead such a pathetic group of men?
"Well, I for one think they are all eager to fight, just look at them!"
Exactly my plan! Hungry men fight for food!
"Sir, I wouldn't say they're pathetic, you're hungry too aren't you? Anyway remember what the mentor said about hospitality?"
"I see... Anyway, remember what mentor said about hospitality?"
"We burn down their houses, steal their women and plunder their stuff!"
"We need a gift for the natives? Yes, I get it."
"No! To show hospitality, we should greet them with gifts! Do you really want what happened with the Cicones to occur again?"
"Yes, let's hope we don't mess it up like with the Cicones."
"Pfft, whatever, I'll go get my stuff ready."
"Odysseus! Before we head off exploring, may I suggest you pick a team of your bravest men instead of lugging all these numbskulls along?"
"I'm sorry... Did I, the hero, need directions?"
"The more the merrier, right? I think I know what I'm doing."
"I like the word numbskulls, can you say it again?"
"Pardon me sir, but I'd like to remind you of how many men we lost because of poor pre-planning, it'd be wise to split up lest there be unforeseen events."
"Sir, we can't afford losing any more muscle, it'd be wise to split up these numbskulls lest there be unforeseen events."
"Very well then, I trust you Elpenor, as I trust all my men. GATHER 'ROUND! All of you will now go through a test to sift out the bravest men!"
"Woah, that's a lot of cheese! Are you ready to return to the ship?"
"I would but I'm curious as to who lives here. Judging from his home, it seems like he would be a feral beast! I'd love to meet someone like him!"
"Feral beast?! Oh my. Well if you insist on staying, I guess we should at least make an offering to the gods for luck."
"Odysseus, we're quite hungry, do you think we could have some of the cheese first?"
"Hey, all for one and one for all! Nobody gets this cheese until we're back on the ship."
"I'm the leader, so I get the lion's share, all of it!"
You want this cheese? None for you!
But we did more work! If anything we should be the ones who get first pick!
What? That's not fair! Aren't we all in this together?
"I'm just kidding! I'm a responsible man. I am delaying your feast of cheese so I should at least allow you to replenish your energy a little. Here, you can share this stack of cheese."
"Greetings, native. The angry god Poseidon has ruined our ships in a fit of rage. We were hoping you'd show us hospitality while we recover from that horrifying encounter."
How dare you foolish mortals speak of the great Poseidon in such a rude manner! I'll teach you a lesson!
AAAAAAHHH!!! HELP!
You... You vile creature! You just devoured 2 of my bravest men!
Vicious beast! You shall feel my wrath!
Looks like they weren't brave enough to stand my wrath! You and your men will feed me for days!
"You, a mere mortal dare to fight me, Polyphemus! The mighty Cyclops?! I'll just eat all of you! You and your men will feed me for days!"
"What do we do? We came here for lunch, not to end up as lunch!"
"Shush, I'll think of a plan, in the meantime I guess we can only wait till morning, there's no escaping now…"
Odysseus! We need more wood to burn but our swords are all blunt from previous cuts! Could you help us out?
"Ah, remind me to execute the blacksmith for crafting such low grade swords for my hand-picked army."
"I pity you, for my sword is the sharpest in all of the land!"
I see you have finally recognized the true glory of my sword. Now you can't help but accept that your sword is no match for mine!
"...Sir, please spare the blacksmith, I merely said that our swords are blunt from prolonged usage."
"Yes, yes, like your sharp wits and looks?"
And what a mighty sword that is! Could you use it to help us cut more firewood then?
"Hmph, clearly you don't know me well. But no matter, I shall gather more wood for everyone. Or I am not Odysseus the Great!"
"Very well! Since you asked so nicely, I will do as requested. The Great Odysseus is always grateful to help!"
"Everyone! I've got a plan that will get us out of here! We need to act fast before the Cyclops returns! Sharpen this branch, no questions asked!"
So how does this work? Are we going to kill the cyclops by stabbing him repeatedly?
Simple. We DON'T kill the Cyclops. We blind him instead. That way he can't see what we do from there on.
We'll pin him to the ground with ropes and use stakes to secure them down.
"Why, the bigger they are the harder they fall. And we'll need this giant stake to do it."
But then we'll need more stakes and we don't have the time!
So your plan is to trip him? I don't see how that would help us escape…
"Well, uh…"
"Interesting, that will give us more time as well! But what if the Cyclops sees the stake? The plan will go to waste!"
"Trust me, I always think ahead! When the stake is out of sight, it is out of mind!"
Where do we hide it then?
"Brilliant idea, Odysseus! He'll never think to look under that pile of manure!"
"Come now, we all know I devise brilliant plans. So, who will be brave enough to execute this plan with me?"
What? That's suicide!
Fight alongside the Great Odysseus? WOW!
"If you're so happy to die, why don't you volunteer?"
"Since all of you obviously have mixed reactions to this, we shall draw lots instead. Line up, men!"
"Haha! You were chosen! Good luck, we'll miss you!"
I was chosen! I think I'm going to faint!
Time to kick some Cyclops butt!
"Heh, these are the exact people I would have picked myself... Oh quick! Hide!"
Mighty Cyclops! We have something we need to say to you!
"Oh look, I guess my meal has come crawling to me. Can't stand the fear? Would you like me to gobble you up to end it now? HAHAHA!"
"Au contraire, Great Cyclops. We have come to our senses and figured that you were hostile to us because we were not nice to you! So to right that wrong, we present you with this red wine! Your mouth will be like nothing you ever imagined!"
Is that so? GIVE IT HERE!
*Gulp Gulp*
"By the name of Poseidon, this liquid, this sweet nectar, is a gift from the heavens! Nothing comes close to its taste on these lands! I'm afraid we haven't properly introduced ourselves, I am the mighty, towering giant, Polyphemus! And who might you be?"
Nobody is my name and starting wars is my bane!
*Gulp Gulp* Nobody eh? What kind of strange name is that? Your parents must have hated you! HAHAHA! MORE!
"How dare you demand more without giving back to us? You're the host here, don't you know what hospitality is?"
More? Not until we get a gift from you too!
"*Ahem* As the gracious host, you should be hospitable to us, no? We've already done our part and brought you a wondrous gift, it's your turn now."
"A GIFT? PFT HAHAHA, I'LL GIVE YOU A GIFT ALRIGHT! MY GIFT IS THAT I SHALL EAT YOU LAST!"
"Tell you what, you got me in a good mood, so I'll play along. I shall bestow upon you, my decision to eat you last! HAHAHA!"
(What a jerk! But my goal is to get him drunk so I'll just have to go with it.)
"Why I humbly thank you, for you are the BEST host I have ever come across, in exchange, please, have more wine."
"*Gulp gulp* *BLURP!* Sweet, sweet nectar... I DEMAND MORE!"
"BLUR BLUR BLUR, NECTAR, WINE, MORE…"
*THUD!*
Any ideas?
"The Cyclops is blind now, isn't he? Why don't we just attack him? After all the entrance is open and we have our swords."
"I can't take the risk, our swords are slightly blunt already. Also, what if the Cyclops manages to close up the entrance! After all, he should know this place like the back of his hand."
"Oooh, I have an idea! We should shear the sheep, and disguise ourselves with the wool! That way he won't know the difference between us and the sheep going outside."
"Interesting plan but we don't have anything to sheer the sheep with. Besides, I don't want to use your swords since I want to bring the sheep back alive. They'll definitely taste better than cheese!"
"Can't we just run out? With only six of us left, he won't possibly be able to catch all of us."
Are you suggesting we sacrifice some men? Preposterous! Our numbers are low enough as it is!
"I have a foolproof idea! Men, gather! The six of you will go round up any male sheep left in this cave, make sure none of them gets out, we need as many sheep as we can get."
"I'll look around for something to bind the sheep together and then each of you will hang underneath the sheep. That way, when the sheep leave the cave, the Cyclops will not be able to know you are there. Stupid as he is, he only inspects the top of each exiting sheep."
"My dear faithful ram, why the last of the flock? You move as if conscious of your master's woe."
Meeehhh-ehhhh.
"I suppose I shouldn't keep you waiting. Go, graze on the lush, green pastures of the land. Always stay safe, remember to return to shelter by night. I'll see you in a few hours, won't I?"
...Mehh-ehhh-ehh.
I take your word for it.
AAAHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Polyphemus! Are you okay?
Nobody is killing me!
"Well then, keep it down!"
"A roman walks into a bar, strides up to the bartender, holds up two fingers and says ""Five beers, please"""
"That's not funny. How about this? A roman walks into a bar and says ""I'll have a martinus please."" ""Don't you mean a martini?"" The bartender asks. The Roman replies ""If I wanted a double I would have asked for it."" "
Hey! Is that a mermaid?
Are you crazy? Mermaids don't exist! It's just a log.
No it's not! I know what I saw.
You're going insane.
"There there, there it is again! You see it?"
What!? Where? I don't see anything! Are you out of your mind?
"Wait wait, can you hear it? Mermaids are singing."
I hear nothing. It's just the winds.
"There it is again! I'm not insane, I'm not insane."
I see it!She's so beautiful!
Did you see it? She is so interested in me. I think she wants me instead of you.
You're joking right? She was distracting you to talk to me.
This miraculous wine will tingle your senses and the burst of flavour will be like nothing you ever imagined!
"You're gonna aid me in my escape, Ram."
