No! I can't combine these!
Only a drunkard would do that.
I can't combine these!
This isn't working right.
What good would that do me?
By the gods! Why can't I combine these?
I cannot do that.

It doesn't make any sense!

You filled the goat skin with wine! You can still fill more wine in!
You filled the goat skin with wine! It's almost full!

"Don’t be so rash Odysseus, we can’t move the slab even with 12 horses!"

Much Better!

Pfff…  don't teach me what to do.
Sir! Why don't you burn the cheese as an offering to the gods!
Pfff…  don't teach me what to do!!

Sir! Please give us the order to kill the cyclops!
I will look around and will think of an idea first

We need to think of a way to get out of here.
The path is now open!
Sir. Do you want anything to eat?
No thanks.
Do you have anything to start a fire with?
No.
Yes sir! Here's a flint!
My hands are too full!
Such a beautiful tree branch.. This gives me an idea!
It's burning brightly!
