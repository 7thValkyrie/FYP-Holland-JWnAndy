Mortal, speak, what is your name?
I am Odysseus, son of Laertes and Anticlea. I have come in search of the prophet Tiresias for instructions on how to return to Ithaca.
Son of Anticlea you say? So you have not heard of the news yet…
Hmm? What news? Also, you knew my mother?
She is an acquaintance of sorts… Anyways, regarding the prophet, I am not sure where he is but you can head to the meeting hall of the dead. There you will find the wives and daughters of rich men who love to gossip even after death. If you have a question, they have an answer. In exchange for this information, I only ask that you help me search for my remains which are scattered throughout this accursed land
Anything for my mother’s friend.
Thank you, and be safe.
Here, are these your remains?
Yes, thanks for the help. Did you… see your mother?
Yes I did. For such a thing to happen while I was away… I need to hurry back to Ithaca.
Godspeed, my friend.
