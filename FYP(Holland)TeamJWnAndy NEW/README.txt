Hi, I'm Leevi Rasila, I worked on this project before you. My group made some changes to chapter 1 and the entirety of chapter 2.

if you get tasked to continue this project, please consider doing the following as we ran out of time:

-Make new graphics for both minigames. They are just placeholders right now.

-Add animation for doing stuff into places. Right now when you pick the grass up, there is a short animation. That animation should be added to other places too where it fits.

-Add hints into the game. Some of the puzzles are not easy enough to complete. I have written most of the hints into the CSV files. I hope you will understand their context by looking at them. For example when using the sword or the spear on the deer on the clearing, it should say something like "It'd escape before I'd strike. I need to be farther away."

-Add the option to interact with things, even if they are not interactable or pick-upable. For example the grass at the start should have the option to pick it up, but should prompt a text "I'd cut my hands if I tried to pick them with my bare hands", for example. These would serve as great hints for the player.

-Add NPCs into the game. There are a few places (front of Circe's castle and the maze) that could benefit from an NPC giving the player a hint about what to do.

Sorry for the trouble, I hope you'll succeed in making the game better!

-Leevi
