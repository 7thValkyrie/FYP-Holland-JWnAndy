Oh poor ghost, why are you shaking?
When I was still alive, I got tricked by a cunning merchant to buy this magical bowl and right after that, it started raining so I hid under the tree with it and soon enough I got struck by lightning and died. I want to get rid of this cursed bowl by throwing it down the bridge, but I am afraid that I will get even more bad luck if I toss the bowl off the cliff. <qns>
Man up! It is just a normal bowl! <choice 1>
Give it to me. I will take on the curse for myself. <choice 2>
Gullible fool! <choice 3>
It is not! The merchant told me it was a magical bowl! <choice 1 ans>
You would do that? For me? Thank you! Thank you so much! I can finally sleep again! Not that I need any… <choice 2 ans>
Wha- How could you say that? <choice 3 ans>
